                        When numbers and figures come together to form a proper analysis, it is called quantitative
                        research. It is majorly used to find patterns and averages, make predictions, and generalize
                        results to a wider population. Quantitative research is widely used in understanding customer
                        psychology and to get accurate marketing positioning. <br> <br>

                        One Way Solution gives you in-depth research by making your result as authentic as possible.
                        From digging in the correct numbers to presenting you with proper facts and figures, all the
                        boxes are ticked under one umbrella.

            <p id="quantitativeresearchbenefit-content">This approach is used when you want to create social awareness
                or
                generate knowledge about the ongoing situation. Unlike qualitative research, there is no room for
                opinions or decisions derived through debates. Here, numbers, data, and graphs play a major role.
                <br><br>

                Using advanced tools and having subject matter experts on board, One Way Solution helps to give you a
                narrower result by giving comprehensive solutions to all the pain points.

                <p id="descriptiveresearch-para">Here, analysis takes place to derive the current status of an
                    identified
                    variable. These research projects are designed to provide systematic information about a particular
                    phenomenon. There are no assumptions involved in the beginning here, but it comes into the picture
                    after collecting relevant data. The information is collected in a standardized manner and each unit
                    is studied carefully to start the hypothesis of the project. <br> <br>

                    Now, this method is majorly used to understand human behaviour in various situations. Some common
                    examples of this could be how scientists feel about global warming, how fifth-grade students spend
                    their time during summer vacations, how parents feel about the twelve-month school year, etc

                    more variables. Correlational research is designed to interpret relations between and among several
                    facts. This will determine the trends and patterns in data and there is no manipulation of
                    information done here. They are identified and studied in their absolute natural setting. <br><br>
